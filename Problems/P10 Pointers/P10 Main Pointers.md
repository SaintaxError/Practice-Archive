# Pointer Problems

---

## **Problem 1: Pointer Basics**
**Description:**  
Declare an integer variable and a pointer. Assign the address of the integer variable to the pointer and print both the value and the address.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Value of num: 10
Address of num: 0x7ffee6b20
Value stored in pointer: 10
Pointer address: 0x7ffee6b20
```

---

## **Problem 2: Pointer Arithmetic**
**Description:**  
Increment and decrement a pointer while printing the addresses before and after the operation.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Address before increment: 0x7ffee6b20
Address after increment: 0x7ffee6b24
Address after decrement: 0x7ffee6b20
```

## **Problem 3: Swapping Two Numbers using Pointers**
**Description:**  
Write a function that swaps two numbers using pointers.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Before swapping: a = 5, b = 10
After swapping: a = 10, b = 5
```

---

## **Problem 4: Array and Pointers**
**Description:**  
Use a pointer to iterate through an array and print all elements.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Array elements: 1 2 3 4 5
```

---

## **Problem 5: Pointer to a Function**
**Description:**  
Create a function that takes two integers and returns their sum. Use a function pointer to call it.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Sum of 5 and 7 is: 12
```

---

## **Problem 6: Dynamic Memory Allocation**
**Description:**  
Allocate memory dynamically for an array using `malloc`, take user input, and print the values.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Enter 3 numbers: 10 20 30
Values stored: 10 20 30
```

---

## **Problem 7: String Manipulation with Pointers**
**Description:**  
Create a function that reverses a string using pointers.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Enter a string: hello
Reversed string: olleh
```

---

## **Problem 8: Pointer to Pointer**
**Description:**  
Declare a pointer to a pointer and print the values at each level.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Value of num: 42
Value stored in pointer: 42
Value stored in pointer to pointer: 42
```

---

## **Problem 9: Structure and Pointers**
**Description:**  
Create a structure `Student` with `name` and `age`, use a pointer to modify and display the structure values.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Enter student name: Alice
Enter student age: 20
Student Name: Alice
Student Age: 20
```

---

## **Problem 10: Array of Pointers**
**Description:**  
Create an array of pointers that store multiple strings and print them.  

**Sample Output:**  
```
Fruits: Apple Banana Cherry
```
