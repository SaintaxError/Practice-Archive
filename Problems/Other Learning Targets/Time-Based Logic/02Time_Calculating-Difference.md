Enter the end date (YYYY-MM): 2022-11 
There are 17 months between 2021-06 and 2022-11.
```

### Problem 6: Find the Exact Difference Between Two Datetimes
**Description:**
Find the exact difference in days, hours, minutes, and seconds between two datetime values.

**Sample Output 1:**
```
Enter the first datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS): 2022-05-10 14:30:00 
Enter the second datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS): 2024-11-15 22:45:10
The exact difference is 912 days, 8 hours, 15 minutes, 10 seconds.
```
**Sample Output 2:**
```
Enter the first datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS): 2023-01-01 00:00:00 
Enter the second datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS): 2024-01-01 00:00:00 
The exact difference is 365 days, 0 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.
```

### Problem 7: Calculate the Number of Full Moons Between Two Dates
**Description:**
Write a function to calculate how many full moons occurred between two dates, knowing that a full moon occurs every 29.53 days.

**Sample Output 1:**
```
Enter the start date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2020-01-01 
Enter the end date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2022-01-01
There are 24 full moons between 2020-01-01 and 2022-01-01.
