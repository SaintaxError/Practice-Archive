# Next Up: Boolean Logic

## Problem 1: Both Positive or Negative
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "both positive" if both integers are positive, "both negative" if both integers are negative, and "mixed" if one is positive and the other is negative.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 10 
Enter second integer: 20 
both positive
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: -5 
Enter second integer: -10 
both negative
```

## Problem 2: Both Even or Odd
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "both even" if both integers are even, "both odd" if both integers are odd, and "mixed" if one is even and the other is odd.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 4 
Enter second integer: 6 
both even
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 7
Enter second integer: 9
both odd
```

## Problem 3: Nested Conditions with OR
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "either both negative or at least one is zero" if both integers are negative 
or at least one of them is zero. Otherwise, return "none of the conditions met".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: -3 
Enter second integer: -4 
either both negative or at least one is zero
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 0 
Enter second integer: 5 
either both negative or at least one is zero
```

## Problem 4: Is Leap Year with AND
### Description:
Ask the user to input a year. Return "leap year" if the year is divisible by 4 and (not divisible by 100 or divisible by 400).

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter a year: 2020 
leap year
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter a year: 1900 
none of the conditions met
```

## Problem 5: Multiple Conditions with AND
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "both positive and sum greater than 10" if both integers are 
positive and their sum is greater than 10. Otherwise, return "conditions not met".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 8 
Enter second integer: 5 
both positive and sum greater than 10
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 3 
Enter second integer: 4 
conditions not met
```

## Problem 6: Age and Height Check
### Description:
Ask the user to input their age and height. Return "eligible for participation" if the user is at least 18 years old and 
their height is greater than or equal to 5 feet. Otherwise, return "not eligible".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter age: 20 
Enter height in feet: 5 
eligible for participation
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter age: 16 
Enter height in feet: 5.5 
not eligible
```

## Problem 7: Age, Height, and Weight Combination
### Description:
Ask the user to input their age, height, and weight. Return "eligible for program" if the user is under 40 years old, taller than 5 feet, and weighs less than 80 kg. Otherwise, return "not eligible".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter age: 30 
Enter height in feet: 5.5 
Enter weight in kg: 70 
eligible for program
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter age: 45 
Enter height in feet: 6 
Enter weight in kg: 75 
not eligible
```

## Problem 8: Combination of Even, Positive, and Divisibility by 3
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Return "even, positive, divisible by 3" if the integer is even, positive, and divisible by 3. 
Otherwise, return "conditions not met".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter a number: 6 
even, positive, divisible by 3
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter a number: 9 
conditions not met
```

## Problem 9: Divisible by 2 and Greater Than 10
### Description:
Ask the user to input a number. Return "divisible by 2 and greater than 10" if the number is divisible by 2 and greater than 10. 
Otherwise, return "conditions not met".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter a number: 14 
divisible by 2 and greater than 10
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter a number: 8 
conditions not met
```

## Problem 10: Odd and Not Divisible by 5
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Return "odd and not divisible by 5" if the integer is odd and not divisible by 5. 
Otherwise, return "conditions not met".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter a number: 7 
odd and not divisible by 5
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter a number: 15 
conditions not met
```
