# Basics of Return Statements: Boolean Operators

## Problem 1: Integer Equalizer
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Print these two integers on the next line separated by a space based on their input order. Then, print "equal" on the next line if these two integers are equal.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 5 
Enter second integer: 5 
5 5 equal
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 7 
Enter second integer: 9 
7 9
```

### Sample Output 3:
```
Enter first integer: -26 
Enter second integer: 26 
-26 26
```

## Problem 2: Positive or Negative?
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Return "positive" if the number is positive, "negative" if the number is negative, 
and "zero" if the number is zero.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 5 
positive
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: -3 
negative
```
### Sample Output 3:
```
Enter an integer: 0 
zero
```
## Problem 3: Both Positive or Negative
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "both positive" if both integers are positive, "both negative" if both integers are negative, and "mixed" if one is positive and the other is negative.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 10 
Enter second integer: 20 
both positive
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: -5 
Enter second integer: -10 
both negative
```
### Sample Output 3:
```
Enter first integer: -7 
Enter second integer: 3 
mixed
```

## Problem 4: Is Divisible by 3?
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Return "divisible" if the number is divisible by 3, and "not divisible" if it is not.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 9 
divisible
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: 10 
not divisible
```

## Problem 5: Even or Odd
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Return "even" if the integer is even, and "odd" if it is odd.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 4
even
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: 7
odd
```

## Problem 6: Both Even or Odd
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "both even" if both integers are even, "both odd" if both integers are odd, and "mixed" if one is even and the other is odd.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 4
Enter second integer: 6
both even
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 7
Enter second integer: 9
both odd
```
### Sample Output 3:
```
Enter first integer: 4
Enter second integer: 9
mixed
```

## Problem 7: Check for Range
### Description:
Ask the user to input a number. Return "within range" if the number is between 10 and 20, and "out of range" if it is not.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter a number: 15
within range
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter a number: 25
out of range
```

## Problem 8: Compare Two Strings
### Description:
Ask the user to input two strings. Return "equal" if the strings are identical, and "not equal" if they are different.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first string: hello
Enter second string: hello
equal
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first string: hello
Enter second string: world
not equal
```

## Problem 9: Is Leap Year?
### Description:
Ask the user to input a year. Return "leap year" if the year is a leap year, and "not leap year" if it is not.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter a year: 2020
leap year
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter a year: 2023
not leap year
```

## Problem 10: Multiple Conditions
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Return "both positive" if both integers are positive and their sum is greater than 10. Return "not both positive" otherwise.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 8
Enter second integer: 5
both positive
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 2
Enter second integer: 3
not both positive
```
