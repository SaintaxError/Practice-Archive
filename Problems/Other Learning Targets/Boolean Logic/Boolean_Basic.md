# Basic: Boolean Logic
## Problem 1: Integer Equalizer
### Description:
Ask the user to input two integers. Then, print these two integers on the next line separated by a space based on their input order. After that, print "equal" if the two integers are the same. Otherwise, print "not equal".

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter first integer: 5 
Enter second integer: 5 
5 5 equal
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter first integer: 7 
Enter second integer: 9 
7 9 not equal
```


## Problem 2: Even or Odd
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Print the integer. Then, print "even" if the number is even, and "odd" if the number is odd.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 4
4 even
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: 7 
7 odd
```

## Problem 3: Divisible by 2 or Not
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Print the integer. Then, print "divisible by 2" if the number is divisible by 2, and "not divisible by 2" if it is not.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 10 
10 divisible by 2
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: 15 
15 not divisible by 2
```

## Problem 4: Greater Than 10 or Not
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Print the integer. Then, print "greater than 10" if the number is greater than 10, and "not greater than 10" if it is 10 or less.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 12 
12 greater than 10
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: 8 
8 not greater than 10
```

## Problem 5: Multiple of 3 or Not
### Description:
Ask the user to input an integer. Print the integer. Then, print "multiple of 3" if the number is a multiple of 3, and "not a multiple of 3" if it is not.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Enter an integer: 9 
9 multiple of 3
```
### Sample Output 2:
```
Enter an integer: 14 
14 not a multiple of 3
```
