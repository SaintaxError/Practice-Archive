# Easy: Assignment Operators Problems

## Problem 1: Adding Two Variables
### Description:
Write a program where two variables, `x` and `y`, are initialized with values. Use the `+=` operator to add the value of `y` to `x` and update `x`. Print the updated value of `x`.

### Sample Output 1:
```
x = 4
y = 6
After addition, x = 10
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
x = 10
y = 15
After addition, x = 25
```

## Problem 2: Multiplying and Assigning
### Description:
Write a program where a variable `z` is initialized to a value. Multiply `z` by 5 using the `*=` operator. Print the value of `z` before and after the operation.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Initial value of z: 2
After multiplication, z = 10
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Initial value of z: 7
After multiplication, z = 35
```

## Problem 3: Subtract and Assign
### Description:
Write a program that subtracts a given value from a variable using the `-=` operator. Initialize `m` with 20 and subtract 8 from it. Print the value of `m` before and after the operation.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Initial value of m: 20
After subtraction, m = 12
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Initial value of m: 50
After subtraction, m = 42
```

## Problem 4: Divide and Assign
### Description:
Write a program where a variable `n` is initialized with a value. Divide `n` by 2 using the `/=` operator. Print the value of `n` before and after the operation.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Initial value of n: 20
After division, n = 10
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Initial value of n: 100
After division, n = 50
```

## Problem 5: Modulus and Assign
### Description:
Write a program where a variable `p` is initialized with a value. Use the `%=` operator to find the remainder when `p` is divided by 3. Print the value of `p` before and after the operation.

### Sample Output 1:
```
Initial value of p: 10
After modulus operation, p = 1
```

### Sample Output 2:
```
Initial value of p: 25
After modulus operation, p = 1
```
