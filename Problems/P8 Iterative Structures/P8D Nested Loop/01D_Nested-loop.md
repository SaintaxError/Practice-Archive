# Nested Loop Problems
---

## **Problem 1: Print a Grid**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print an `N x N` grid of asterisks (`*`).

- Use **nested loops** to print the grid.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 4
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
* * * *
```

## **Problem 2: Multiplication Table**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a multiplication table up to `N x N`.

- Use **nested loops** to print the multiplication table.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 3
1 2 3
2 4 6
3 6 9
```

---

## **Problem 3: Number Triangle**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a triangle of numbers with `N` rows.

- Use **nested loops** to print the number pattern.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

## **Problem 4: Right-Angled Triangle with Stars**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a right-angled triangle with stars (`*`), where each row has an increasing number of stars.

- Use **nested loops** to print the star pattern.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 4
*
**
***
****
```

---

## **Problem 5: Multiples of a Number**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a pattern of multiples of `N`.

- Use **nested loops** to print the multiples of `N` in a grid-like pattern, where each row contains multiples of `N`.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 3
3 6 9 12
3 6 9 12
3 6 9 12
```

---

## **Problem 6: Star Pyramid**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a pyramid of stars, where the number of stars increases with each row.

- Use **nested loops** to print the pyramid shape.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 4
   *
  ***
 *****
*******
```

---

## **Problem 7: Number Grid (Reverse)**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print an `N x N` grid of numbers, but in reverse order starting from `N x N`.

- Use **nested loops** to print the grid with numbers counting down.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 3
9 8 7
6 5 4
3 2 1
```

---

## **Problem 8: Checkerboard Pattern**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a checkerboard pattern with `*` and spaces.

- Use **nested loops** to alternate between `*` and spaces for the checkerboard pattern.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 4
*   *
   * 
*   *
   *
```

---

## **Problem 9: Right-Angled Triangle (Decreasing Stars)**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a right-angled triangle with stars, but in reverse order (starting with `N` stars in the first row).

- Use **nested loops** to print the reverse right-angled triangle.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 4
****
***
**
*
```

---

## **Problem 10: Diamond Shape with Numbers**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number `N` and print a diamond shape, where the first half of the diamond has numbers, and the second half is a mirror image.

- Use **nested loops** to print the diamond shape.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
    1
   1 2
  1 2 3
 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
 1 2 3 4
  1 2 3
   1 2
    1
```
