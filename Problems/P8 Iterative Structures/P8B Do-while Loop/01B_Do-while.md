## **Problem 1: Print Numbers**

**Description:** Print numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user.

- The program should continue asking the user for the input until the number entered is greater than 0.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
1
2
3
4
5
```

## **Problem 2: Sum of Numbers**

**Description:** Ask the user to enter numbers and calculate their sum. The program should keep asking for numbers until the user enters 0.

- If the user enters 0, the loop should stop and print the total sum.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: 0
Sum: 12
```

## **Problem 3: Factorial Calculation**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number and calculate its factorial.

- A factorial of a number `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

- The program should continue until the user enters a number greater than or equal to 1.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

---

## **Problem 4: Reverse Number**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number and reverse it.

- The program should reverse the number by repeatedly extracting the last digit and building the reverse.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 1234
Reversed number: 4321
```

## **Problem 5: Number Guessing Game**

**Description:** Generate a random number between 1 and 100, and ask the user to guess it.

- If the user guesses wrong, print whether the guess is too high or too low, and keep asking for guesses until the user guesses the correct number.

**Sample Output:**

```
Guess the number (1-100): 50
Too high!
Guess the number (1-100): 30
Too low!
Guess the number (1-100): 40
Correct! The number is 40.
```

## **Problem 6: Multiplication Table**

**Description:** Ask the user to enter a number and display its multiplication table from 1 to 10.

- The program should repeat the multiplication table process until the user enters a number less than 1.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 3
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
...
3 x 10 = 30
```

---

## **Problem 7: Fibonacci Sequence**

**Description:** Ask the user for the number of terms and display the Fibonacci sequence up to that many terms.

- The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

- The program should continue until the user enters a positive number.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter the number of terms: 5
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3
```

---

## **Problem 8: Sum of Digits**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number and calculate the sum of its digits.

- The program should repeat the process of extracting digits and summing them up until the user enters a positive number.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 1234
Sum of digits: 10
```

---

## **Problem 9: Odd or Even Counter**

**Description:** Ask the user to enter numbers and count how many are odd and how many are even.

- The program should continue until the user enters a negative number to stop.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 5
Enter a number: 6
Enter a number: 7
Enter a number: -1
Even count: 1
Odd count: 2
```

---

## **Problem 10: Prime Number Checker**

**Description:** Ask the user for a number and check if it is a prime number.

- If the number is prime, print "Prime number."
- If the number is not prime, print "Not a prime number."

- The program should continue until the user enters a number greater than 1.

**Sample Output:**

```
Enter a number: 11
Prime number.
```
